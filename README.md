# hello-world
First sandbox repo to explore and familiarize myself with Github features.
I'm interested in understanding Github, particularly around source control, getting back to a previous version, and project versioning provisions.
I also noticed that there is an option for labeling. I need to further investigate that.
And my fingernails need trimming.
